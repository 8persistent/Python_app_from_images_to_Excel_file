# app_from_images_to_Excel_file
 This program extracts text from images in a specified folder and saves it in a new Excel file (Python)


This program extracts text from images in a specified folder and saves it in a new Excel file. The pytesseract library, based on OCR technology, is used to recognize text in the images. The user can specify the path to the folder containing the images and the name of the output file. The program also checks for supported image formats and reports an error if no suitable files are found in the specified folder.




Please note that you will need to replace the input_folder variable with the path to the folder containing your images and possibly change the path to the tesseract.exe file depending on where it is installed on your computer.
